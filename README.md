Hi!
===========

This is my approach of the **Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata** for Kotlin and Java. If you want to check out the original 
repository, go to [GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). 
There you can find more about this project, the original code and the requirements.

Disclaimer
---------------

I did the refactoring to my best knowledge, but it is probably not at the 'final' stage.
It was also heavily influenced by this article: [the-gilded-rose-refactoring-kata](https://medium.com/@gabriellamedas/the-gilded-rose-refactoring-kata-2dd2d6f52601).

Both solutions, for Java and Kotlin, are more or less the same, just differ in the language specific parts.

Further modifications
---------------

- **Java** updated to version **21**
- **Gradle** updated to version **8.11**
- **Kotlin** updated to version **2.0.21**
